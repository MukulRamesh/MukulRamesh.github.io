    Objective:
</header>
<div>
    In this game, you will be asked to choose the word that seems the most "in-between" out of 3 words.
</div>

<br>

<header>
    How to play:
</header>
<div>
    In order to select your answer, drag the chosen word to the dashed box, or press a number key (1, 2, or 3).
</div>
<div style="font-weight: 600;">
    Use your intuition.
</div>
<div>
    The timer at the top of the page will count down from 60 seconds. Try and get as many as you can!
</div>
<div>
    Don't be too hasty though: there is a streak bonus! The more you get right consecutively, the more points you get!
</div>

<br>

<header>
    Scoring:
</header>
<div>
    Each correct answer will get you 3 points, plus a bonus based on your streak.
</div>
<div>
    The bonus is equal to your streak times 3.
</div>
<div>
    For example, if you get three correct in a row the first answer will get you 3 points, the next will get you 6, and the final one will get you 9.
</div>
<div>
    So, getting three correct consecutively will give you 18 points in total.
</div>
