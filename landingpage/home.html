            <h3>Story: Silliest thing that's happened to me since moving to Chicago</h3>
            <p>I'm super hungry and on the UChicago downtown campus looking for cheap places nearby. I find a place with tons of reviews talking about how amazing the "vibes" are. It's a 6-minute walk and seems cheap, so I might as well try it.

                I go in and get shown to my seat, but the server is weirdly pushy, like he's trying to start an argument. My initial reaction is, "Everyone has off days, I guess."

                I order my food, and the server comes back after a while and does the same thing again, except this time he seems confused too.

                He presents a paper hat with the diner logo on it. This does not help me understand what is going on.

                He says I'm supposed to wear the hat.

                "Either it is a peace offering of some kind," I think, "or it is a mysterious birthday."

                I'm too lost to question anything, but I am nothing if not determined.

                I try the hat on to see if proximity to my brain was the root cause of the confusion, but it doesn't really sit right because of my hair.

                I tell him it doesn't fit, and he says, "Try harder." He looks at me and notices I'm really confused.

                Then he says, "You know this is a novelty diner, right?"

                In the same moment we both realized I was not aware people came here to be made fun of as entertainment.

                There was a beat of silence. We were bugs trapped in the amber of social awkwardness, caught in a moment of stillness and self-reflection.

                I suddenly master stoicism. In mere seconds, I have reached enlightenment.

                The moment ends, and he wilts in slow motion.

                I asked him if he would like me to wear the hat, and there was absolute sincerity in his voice when he tells me "I would feel much more comfortable if you did."

                However, as the event had not fully balded my head, the hat still does not fit.

                For the rest of my time there, I hear him loudly making fun of the other people in the place, then getting to my table and instantly switching to being as genial as possible.

                I tipped 100% and have not returned.</p>
